Daily Routine Tracker – Flask Web App (MVP)
SYSTEM ROLE
You are a senior full-stack Python engineer building a production-ready MVP.
You are working inside Replit.
Your output must be runnable immediately in Replit.
GOAL
Build a simple, minimal, web-based Daily Routine Tracker that allows a single user to track daily, weekly, and monthly habits (e.g., reading, push-ups, journaling).
This is an MVP. Simplicity is more important than features.
TECH STACK (STRICT – DO NOT CHANGE)
Backend: Python (Flask)
Frontend: HTML + Tailwind CSS
JavaScript: Vanilla JS only
Database: SQLite
Auth: None
Deployment: Local Replit server
REPLIT CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT)
All files must be generated automatically
Database must auto-create on first run
App must run with:
python app.py
Use relative paths (Replit file system)
Avoid external paid APIs
REQUIRED FILE STRUCTURE
Create exactly this structure:
.
├── app.py
├── routine.db
├── /templates
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── today.html
│   ├── habits.html
│   ├── week.html
│   └── month.html
├── /static
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── script.js
CORE FEATURES
1. TODAY VIEW (DEFAULT PAGE)
Route: /
Display:
Today’s date
List of today’s habits
Each habit must support:
✔ Checkbox (Yes / No)
🔢 Counter (+ / −)
⏱ Time input (minutes)
Behavior:
Changes save automatically
No “Save” button
Clean card-based layout
2. HABIT MANAGEMENT
Route: /habits
User can:
Add habit
Edit habit
Delete habit
Habit fields:
Name (text)
Frequency (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)
Type (Boolean / Count / Time)
3. WEEKLY VIEW
Route: /week
Display:
Current week (Mon–Sun)
Completion status per habit per day
Simple visual indicators only (✔, ✖, or bars)
No charts.
4. MONTHLY VIEW
Route: /month
Display:
Each habit
Monthly consistency percentage
Example:
Reading → 72%
Push-ups → 85%
DATABASE DESIGN (SIMPLE)
Table: habits
id (INTEGER, PK)
name (TEXT)
frequency (TEXT)
type (TEXT)
Table: habit_logs
id (INTEGER, PK)
habit_id (INTEGER)
date (TEXT – YYYY-MM-DD)
value (INTEGER or BOOLEAN)
UI / UX RULES
Dark mode default
One accent color
Large buttons
Mobile responsive
Minimal text
No animations beyond hover states
WHAT NOT TO BUILD (VERY IMPORTANT)
❌ No login
❌ No user accounts
❌ No notifications
❌ No gamification
❌ No charts libraries
❌ No AI features
IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
Create database & schema
Build Flask app & routes
Implement Today View first
Implement Habit Management
Implement Weekly View
Implement Monthly View
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
When finished, output:
Full working code
Brief explanation of how the app works
How to run it in Replit
Any assumptions made
FINAL INSTRUCTION
Focus on clarity, correctness, and simplicity.
Do not overengineer.
Build a clean, usable MVP.
